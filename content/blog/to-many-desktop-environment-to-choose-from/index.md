## The Choice/Customization Doesn't Sale

**Linux** has a desktop environment problem and that is there are too many to choose from with even more configurations to choose from. This can be overwhelming for new users who are trying to find the right desktop environment for their needs. And to be honest, it can be overwhelming for experienced users as well.

So why is the big push for using Linux as a desktop operating system all about the choices and customization? If this is not why most people that switch to Linux in the first place. Case in point the majority of users don't even change the default settings of their desktop environment. They just use it as is.

| Desktop Environment | Base Features                                   | Best Use Cases                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GNOME               | Modern UI, extensions, Wayland support, search  | General use, productivity, accessibility|
| KDE Plasma          | Highly customizable, widgets, performance       | Power users, customization, multitasking|
| XFCE                | Lightweight, fast, simple interface             | Older hardware, minimal setups          |
| LXQt                | Ultra-lightweight, modular, low resource usage  | Very old PCs, resource-limited systems  |
| Cinnamon            | Traditional layout, user-friendly, applets      | Windows switchers, ease of use          |
| MATE                | Classic GNOME 2 feel, stability, simplicity     | Legacy hardware, GNOME 2 fans           |
| Budgie              | Sleek design, Raven sidebar, notifications      | Modern look, simplicity, Solus users    |
| Pantheon            | Elegant, macOS-like, minimal distractions       | Elementary OS users, design focus       |

That is only about half of the desktop environments that are available for Linux. There are many more that are not listed here, and each one has its own unique features and benefits. This can make it difficult for users to find the right desktop environment for their needs. And it doesn't help that the ones you need to spend a day researching how to configure it and then another day or two to actually configure it to your liking.

**I'm talking about you Arch Linux users.**

## How Did We Get Here?

The desktop environment problem in Linux has its roots in the early days of the operating system. When Linux was first created, it was primarily used by developers and enthusiasts who were comfortable with command-line interfaces. As Linux grew in popularity, especially among desktop users, the need for user-friendly graphical interfaces became apparent.

The first DE to be widely adopted was KDE and if it stopped there we would not have the problem we have today. However, GNOME soon followed, and with it came a wave of new desktop environments. Each new DE was created to address perceived shortcomings in existing ones, leading to a proliferation of options.
