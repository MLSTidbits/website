## The Choice/Customization Doesn't Sale

**Linux** has a desktop environment problem and that is there are too many to choose from with even more configurations to choose from. This can be overwhelming for new users who are trying to find the right desktop environment for their needs. And to be honest, it can be overwhelming for experienced users as well.

So why is the big push for using Linux as a desktop operating system all about the choices and customization? If this is not why most people that switch to Linux in the first place. Case in point the majority of users don't even change the default settings of their desktop environment. They just use it as is.

| Desktop Environment | Base Features                                   | Best Use Cases                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GNOME               | Modern UI, extensions, Wayland support, search  | General use, productivity, accessibility|
| KDE Plasma          | Highly customizable, widgets, performance       | Power users, customization, multitasking|
| XFCE                | Lightweight, fast, simple interface             | Older hardware, minimal setups          |
| LXQt                | Ultra-lightweight, modular, low resource usage  | Very old PCs, resource-limited systems  |
| Cinnamon            | Traditional layout, user-friendly, applets      | Windows switchers, ease of use          |
| MATE                | Classic GNOME 2 feel, stability, simplicity     | Legacy hardware, GNOME 2 fans           |
| Budgie              | Sleek design, Raven sidebar, notifications      | Modern look, simplicity, Solus users    |
| Pantheon            | Elegant, macOS-like, minimal distractions       | Elementary OS users, design focus       |

That is only about half of the desktop environments that are available for Linux. There are many more that are not listed here, and each one has its own unique features and benefits. This can make it difficult for users to find the right desktop environment for their needs. And it doesn't help that the ones you need to spend a day researching how to configure it and then another day or two to actually configure it to your liking.

**I'm talking about you Arch Linux users.**

## How Did We Get Here?

The desktop environment problem in Linux has its roots in the early days of the operating system. When Linux was first created, it was primarily used by developers and enthusiasts who were comfortable with command-line interfaces. As Linux grew in popularity, especially among desktop users, the need for user-friendly graphical interfaces became apparent.

The first DE to be widely adopted was KDE and if it stopped there we would not have the problem we have today. However, GNOME soon followed, and with it came a wave of new desktop environments. Each new DE was created to address perceived shortcomings in existing ones, leading to a proliferation of options.

In someways this is what led to Windows and macOS being so popular and caused Linux distributions to be so fragmented.

## Is There a Solution?

In my opinion, there is no fix because the problem has been around for so long that it is now part of the Linux ecosystem. The best we can do is to try to make the choice easier for users by providing clear information about each desktop environment and its features.

This can include things like:

- **Comparison charts** that highlight the key features of each desktop environment.
- **User reviews** that provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each DE.
- **Guides and tutorials** that help users get started with their chosen desktop environment.
- **Community support** that can answer questions and provide assistance with configuration and customization.

The true is **KDE Plasma** is the best desktop environment for [Windows](https://windows.com) users looking to switch to Linux; and **Pantheon** is the best desktop environment for [macOS](https://apple.com) users. However, the choice of desktop environment ultimately comes down to personal preference. Some users may prefer the simplicity and speed of XFCE, while others may prefer the modern look and feel of GNOME. The important thing is that users have the freedom to choose the desktop environment that works best for them.

Although, because **GMOME** is so customizable and has so many extensions it can be configured to look and feel like any other desktop environment. But there are so few distributions that ship with GNOME configured this way--only **Pop!_OS** and **Zorin OS** come to mind--that it is not a viable option for most users.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the desktop environment problem in Linux is a complex issue that has its roots in the early days of the operating system. While there is no easy solution, we can make the choice easier for users by providing clear information about each desktop environment and its features. Ultimately, the choice of desktop environment comes down to personal preference, and users should have the freedom to choose the one that works best for them.

One of the biggest thing is that all DE's use significantly less resources than Windows and macOS to some degree. This means that even hardware that is 15 years old can run a modern desktop environment with ease. This is one of the biggest selling points of Linux as a desktop operating system.

The only time that a user may need more current hardware is if they are using the system for video, photo, or audio editing: Not including gaming.
