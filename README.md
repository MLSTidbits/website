This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. In addition the theme is a direct implementation of the [hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra) theme Provided by [imfing](https://github.com/imfing).

## What This is For

The website is a collection of tidbits, tips, and tricks that I have found useful in my journey over the last 15 years as a '**Newbie**' Linux power user. I started this to help myself remember things I have learned, because I think that I have forgotten more than I remember. I hope that this can help others as well.
